### How To Read a Violin Plot (right)
* A violin plot is a density plot, mirrored.
* A violin plot shows the number of people who contributed a certain amount.
* If most of the area in this plot is squished into the left-hand side, this means a few people gave a large amount of money.
	* Typically if this is the case, it is the candidate or the party who gave a large amount to their campaign.
	* Large amounts are also often "in kind" donations, which are non-monetary gifts.  There is an option in the sidebar to remove these types of contributions.
